# List Away
To-do list and event viewer web application for the weary student or anyone else for that matter

This is the project we made for COMP-1930 Projects. Our project uses the following:
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap 4
  * Firebase Cloud Storage
  
The link to our web app can be found [here](https://list-615f1.firebaseapp.com/).

## Lists
You can create lists to keep track of things that you need to do.

After creating a list, you will be able to add tasks that you need to do.

Tasks can be marked as complete, and will be grayed out and moved to the bottom of the list.

A list can be modified or deleted at any time.

## Events
For time-sensitive things you need to keep track off, you can create events.

You will be able to assign a date, priority, and description to your event after creating one.

Events are automatically ordered from earliest to latest date.

Just like lists, events can be modified or deleted at any time.
